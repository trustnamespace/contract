## What is Trust Name Space ?

Trust Name Space (TNS) is a standart that helps manage reputation and verify the accuracy of information on the Internet. It runs on Ethereum blockchain technology, which makes it reliable. In an age where artificial intelligence can easily create fake news, TNS aims to train people to check sources of information. This is achieved thanks to the reliability of blockchain technologies and the use of cryptographic signatures for documents. TNS uses a unique economic model. They distribute 85% of the value of names to the owners of those names. Their system also uses the deflationary token model of the $True project, where 10% of the tokens from the initial value of the name are destroyed.
